                    <li> <b> Pizza Hut was launched on May 31, 1958, by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita
                            State
                            students, as a single location in Wichita, Kansas. Six months later they opened a second
                            outlet,
                            and within a year they had six Pizza Hut restaurants.</b></li>

                    <li><i>One early employee was future Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells, who had
                            worked
                            for
                            the company while a college student and football player at Wichita State University.
                            Parcells
                            was
                            considering a franchise for a career (as well as law school), but instead chose to enter
                            coaching,
                            eventually becoming a head coach in the National Football League.</i></li>

                    <li><strong>The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizza Hut building style was designed
                            in
                            1963 by
                            Chicago architect George Lindstrom and was implemented in 1969.</strong> </li>

                            PepsiCo acquired Pizza Hut in November 1977. Twenty years later, Pizza Hut (alongside Taco
                            Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken) were spun off by PepsiCo on May 30, 1997, and all three

                            assumed
                            the
                            name of Yum! Brands on May 22, 2002.</em></li>

                    <li><mark> August 1994, Pizza Hut and the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) announced PizzaNet, a pilot

                            the Santa Cruz area that allowed consumers to use their own computer to order pizza delivery
                            from a
                            local Pizza Hut restaurant, with connection being made over the Internet to a central Pizza
